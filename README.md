This paper presents a novel framework for intrusion detection specially designed for cyberattacks, such as Denial-of-Service, Distributed Denial-of-Service, Distributed Reflection Denial-of-Service, Brute Force, Botnets, and Sniffing, on vehicles that are situated in the Internet of Vehicles environment. We propose an intrusion detection system based on machine learning that is capable of detecting abnormal behavior by examining network traffic to find unusual data flows. In this paper, we have presented a strategy for intrusion detection through a careful evaluation and selection of the most effective techniques for the following steps of the machine learning process: (i) data preprocessing by using Z-score normalization that preserves the data distribution for the proposed method and handles outliers; (ii) feature selection by using a regression model that simplifies the model complexity and reduces the execution time; and (iii) model selection and training – Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Categorical Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine – with hyperparameter optimization to control the behavior in the training phase and to prevent overfitting. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments carried out using the well-known standard datasets CIC-IDS-2017, CSE-CIC-IDS-2018, and CIC-DDoS-2019, both separately and merged. We achieved a high accuracy above 99.8% within a running time of 46.9 s and 0.24 s detection time for the three combined intrusion detection system datasets, thereby showing that the proposed intrusion detection system outperforms the previous methods introduced in the literature.

 <div align="justify"> The operations of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are susceptible to cybersecurity risks, mainly because of their firm reliance on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and radio frequency (RF) sensors. GPS and RF sensors are vulnerable to potential threats, such as spoofing attacks that can cause the UAVs to behave erratically. Since these threats are widespread and potent, it is imperative to develop effective intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose an image-based intrusion detection system for detecting GPS spoofing cyberattacks based on a deep learning methodology. We combine convolutional neural networks with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset features, data augmentation to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, and transfer learning to improve the proposed model’s performance with limited data to design a fast, accurate, and general method. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution carried out using benchmark datasets. We achieved an accuracy of 100% within a running time of 120.64 s at 0.3529 ms latency and a detection time of 2.035 s in the case of the training dataset. Further, using this trained model, we achieved an accuracy of 99.25% within a detection time of 2.721 s on an unseen dataset that was unrelated to the one used for training the model. In contrast, other models, such as Inception-v3, showed lower accuracy on unseen datasets. However, Inception-v3 performance improved significantly after Bayesian optimization, with the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator reaching 99.06% accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the proposed image-based intrusion detection method outperforms the existing solutions while providing a general model for detecting cyberattacks included in unseen datasets.</div>
